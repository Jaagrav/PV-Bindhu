# PV-Bindhu

A firefox extension meant for lazy people that presses the 'Skip Intro' button for you on PrimeVideo. You can create PRs to add other OTT services.

## In the name PV Bindhu,
PV stands for Prime Video and Bin in Bindhu stands for Binge, I made this because professional binge-watchers like me need to be ultimately lazy and this increases my binge watching productivity by 2.333% which is a significant hike when it comes to binge-watching.
